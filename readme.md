# Ginny Lover

PC Side ASETNIOP input method designed for the Ginny keyboard. Designed for use
with the included firmware. This firmware outputs using GeminiPR with this bit
layout:

```
00000000 00000000 [00000000] 00000000 00000000 00000000
  asetni [thumbs]   ^                          op      
                    |
            right chord? (1 or 0)
```

The spacebar outputs F15, as it is independent from the chording.
